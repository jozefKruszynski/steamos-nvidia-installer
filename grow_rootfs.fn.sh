# Grow rootfs-A/B on an existing installation by physically relocating the
# home partition's data forward, then reclaiming the space it vacates.
# Runs from the live USB, before the OS is imaged, against the target
# disk's UNMOUNTED partitions only.
#
# Why a physical relocation at all: resize2fs only ever changes a
# filesystem's END — it never moves its START. So shrinking home and then
# just rewriting the partition table to say home "starts later" does NOT
# make that true; the real data stays exactly where it physically was, and
# the table would point at empty space while var-A/B/rootfs-B's new,
# bigger ranges silently overlap home's real (untouched) data. That overlap
# is exactly what a completed (non-interrupted) run of an earlier, broken
# version of this function would have overwritten. Growing rootfs-A/B
# safely therefore requires physically relocating home's data forward,
# byte for byte — the same thing GParted does internally for a "move" (not
# just "resize"). This does that:
#   1. benchmark a real read off this disk and use it to give the user an
#      actual time estimate before asking for confirmation
#   2. verify the current partition layout matches what the eventual table
#      rewrite assumes (rootfs-A/B, var-A/B, home contiguous, in that
#      order, 1MiB-aligned) — refuse before touching anything if not
#   3. shrink+fsck home (offline resize2fs, verified against its actual
#      minimum size so real files can't be truncated)
#   4. physically copy the shrunk range forward by the exact shift amount,
#      in chunks equal to that shift, HIGH-TO-LOW — the only order that's
#      memmove-safe on overlapping ranges without needing anything fancier
#      than dd (any given chunk's destination never lands on a not-yet-read
#      source, since the chunk ahead of it was already relocated out of
#      the way first)
#   5. checksum every chunk immediately before/after moving it — abort
#      before ever touching the partition table on any mismatch
#   6. fsck the relocated filesystem at its new physical offset,
#      independent of the (still old, still correct) partition table
#   7. only now rewrite the partition table, read it back to confirm home
#      actually landed where the relocated data was written, then fsck
#      once more through the normal device path to confirm table and data
#      agree
#
# Interruption: a chunk's source is left untouched only until the PREVIOUS
# (higher-index) chunk overwrites it — so past the very first chunk,
# blindly retrying step 4 from the top is NOT safe. Chunk i's destination
# is chunk i+1's original source, so a second pass re-reads already-shifted
# data and shifts it again — double-moving everything and destroying the
# first (highest-index) chunk's data outright. Instead, step 4 keeps a
# progress record — {disk GUID, home start, shift amount, chunk count,
# next chunk index} — on the live environment's OWN storage (next to this
# script, never the target disk), fsynced after every verified chunk and
# removed only once the partition table rewrite (step 7) has completed. On
# entry, a record matching this disk/geometry resumes the loop exactly
# where it left off (skipping the shrink and its fsck, already done); a
# record that exists but doesn't match refuses instead of guessing.
# Mounts a root slot, grows its btrfs to fill whatever its partition's
# CURRENT size is, and verifies the result actually reached that size
# instead of trusting the exit code alone -- "resize max" has been observed
# to exit 0 without fully taking effect on one slot, cause unconfirmed.
# Non-fatal on ANY failure here (best-effort enlargement, not worth
# aborting the whole repair over -- a slot that isn't mountable right now
# for whatever reason was either about to be overwritten anyway or is none
# of this function's business) but always LOUD about it, so a silent
# no-op like that doesn't go unnoticed again.

  # 'btrfs filesystem resize max' after each dd -- so growing them again
  # here is both redundant and, worse, guaranteed to abort on rootfs-B
  # with no path forward (table already rewritten, home already relocated,
  # no OS bootable). The pre-sgdisk pass near the top of this function
  # covers the one legitimate leftover case: an already-grown table whose
  # filesystem was never grown to match.
